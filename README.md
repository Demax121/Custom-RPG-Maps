# What is custom maps project?

The custom maps project has been created to help people with hosting their own maps created from static images on the web but it can also be used with OpenStreetMap or any other map api.

## Key features

In the tab marked with the globe :earth_africa: icon are displayed markers that can be fetched from the database and parsed into JSON or from static JSON file. The *test overlay* is the name of an overlay within which markers that belong to the same overlay are stored. When the marker in the sidebar is clicked the map zooms onto it and it's popup is opened.
